                Welcome to Web Server administration with additional features
            </h3>
            <p>
                First... let's answer some questions
            </p>

            <h4>What is a webser ?</h4>
            <p>
                "Web server" can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.
                On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's
                component files (e.g. HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files).It is connected to
                the Internet or local network and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected.<br>
                On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted
                files, at minimum an HTTP server. An HTTP server is a piece of software that understands URLs (web
                addresses) and HTTP (the protocol that browsers uses to view webpages). It can be accessed through the
                domain names (like www.google.com.ar or, it's knows, IP address) of websites it stores, and delivers
                their content to the end-user's
                device.

            <h4>What is a embedded system ? and a Raspberry Pi ?</h4>
            <p>
                An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software, either fixed in capability or
                programmable, designed for a specific function or functions within a larger system. Industrial machines,
                agricultural and process industry devices, automobiles, medical equipment, cameras, household
                appliances, airplanes, vending machines and toys, as well as mobile devices, are possible locations for
                an embedded system.<br>
                In relationship, a Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer
                monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people
                of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s
                capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and
                playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

            <h4>About this WebServer</h4>
            <p>
                This server runs on a Raspberry Pi 3+ with Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.4GHz
                1GB LPDDR2 SDRAM 64-bit quad-core processor, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.2/BLE, faster Ethernet,
                and Power-over-Ethernet support. <br>
                The operating system is Arch Linux <br>
                The CGI module works with perl language.
